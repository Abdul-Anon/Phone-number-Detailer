## Lessons Learned

- What did I learn while building this project? 
I learnt to solve problem by coming up with meaningful variable names

I found it extremely difficult to estimate how many surprises a programming problem will present before it has been tried in practice.
So I stopped.

- What challenges did I faced and how did you overcome them?  
Well, some were estimating time to complete tasks and even. 

Choosing names that convey what the thing is or does, consistently across the application and concise.
